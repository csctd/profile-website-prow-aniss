# About Me
Hello :]

I'm Aniss! URI student who's majoring in a B.S. of Data Science. I've aLways had a vested interest in computers, having grown up around them. Despite this, I'm still pretty much a beginner when it comes to this stuff! I hope to get better though- coding's something that's always been insanely interesting to me, and being able to do it is honestly pretty fun.

Outside of that, I enjoy playing video games, writing, and do occasional 3d art using Blender on the side! Nothing impressive, at least for *now >:)*

This'll probably get longer as time goes on, but for now? Yeah, this is it.
