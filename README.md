Welcome to my profile webiste, brosephs!
<!-- enter your target audience after the comma above -->

<!-- make a bulleted list of 3 fictional visitors to your site. Include a few detials about them that could impact how you design for them. For each visitor, assign a task or goal they have for visiting your profile website -->

## Design
When it comes to my website's design, I want it to be organized- buttons for each of the categories I'm talking about that bring you to what you want immediately

## Accessibility
It should be easy to navigate and easy on the eyes! I don't like ugly websites, so I'll try not to make it ugly :)
